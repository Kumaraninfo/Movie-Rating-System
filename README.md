# Movie-Rating-System

The Movie Review System built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript offers a streamlined platform for users to browse, review, 
and interact with movie data in a user-friendly interface. The system displays a catalog of movies with details such as title,
genre, and synopsis, presented in a visually appealing grid or list format. Users can explore movies, search by title or genre, 
and filter results to find specific films of interest.

Central to the system is the ability for users to submit reviews. Each review includes a rating and optional comment, contributing 
to an average rating calculation displayed dynamically for each movie. JavaScript handles form validation to ensure required fields
are filled before submission, enhancing data integrity.

The interface is responsive, ensuring accessibility across devices with layouts optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
Interactive elements such as star ratings enable intuitive feedback mechanisms, encouraging user engagement and enhancing the user experience.

For data management, the system utilizes JSON format to store movie details and reviews within the application. CRUD operations
are managed through JavaScript, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete reviews seamlessly within the interface.

This project not only demonstrates proficiency in frontend web development but also showcases practical implementation of interactive 
features and data-driven functionalities essential for modern web applications. It serves as a versatile platform for movie enthusiasts to 
explore, review, and interact with movie data efficiently and effectively.
